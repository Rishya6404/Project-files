How ESP32 PROJECT Works:
The Transmitter ESP32 reads soil moisture data from the sensor and sends it wirelessly using nRF24L01.
The Receiver ESP32 receives the data, displays it in the Serial Monitor, and controls the water pump relay based on the moisture level.
If moisture is below 30%, the pump turns ON; if it's above 30%, the pump turns OFF
